# LiveNation
#Run the code via the browser using the following url:  http://localhost:58434/api/values/livenation?inputs=1,20

Created the interface class and rule classes, added a boolean method for the mutiples as i analysed this from the question. Properties were also added and a print method to print the results if the multiples were true. Futhermore another class was added for the rules to do the counts and checked if the results matched. The controller was modifed in order to get the results from the url by the users input.
I tried to adhere to SOLID principles and done some TDD tests for invalid inputs as well as the expected input.
The code is able to return back the json result displaying the result and summary of all the values counted as expected.
However due to the time scale i was unable to do more test cases.
